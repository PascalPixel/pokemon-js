## About

A clone of the very first battle in the first generation of Pokémon GAMEBOY games by Game Freak published by Nintendo.

It started in 2013 as a way of refining web technology skills for Pascal Pixel and now Superpencil, then evolved to include (originally, perhaps not in the current iteration) `PHP`, `GET` requests, `jQuery`, `JSON` to dynamically call specific monsters from an index (Pokédex), `API` usage, `SVG`, dynamic SVG coloring, CSS 3D `transforms`, responsive interfaces based on `em` units, and full mastery of `SASS` and `SCSS`.

We plan to move the project into React & Redux next to get a hold on those new technologies as well.

The font used is an extended version of the original available on Github: [PascalPixel/pokemon-font](http://github.com/PascalPixel/pokemon-font)
